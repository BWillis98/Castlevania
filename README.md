# Castlevania
My very first video game I am trying to create. This is a replication of the old school Castlevania. Let's have some fun!

EDIT: I did not post on here for a long time because I worked on the game for a very long time and just didn't keep posting updates on this repo. I worked into the repo of Joshua Crotts who forked my original project. Because he doesn't understand how to use github very well, I had to work under his repo. This is the final product however
